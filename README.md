# Bus_Stop_Board

## Description
A prototype bus stop board to help me maximise sleep and minimise the number of times I arrive late for work. To shave off precious seconds of my morning routine I decided to build an online bus board through Observable, therefore removing the arduous task of entering my route into CityMapper. 

[The Observable hosted board can be found at this link.](https://observablehq.com/@domherriott/wandsworth-road-bus-station)

The tool uses javascript to request bus arrival times for the Wandsworth Road bus stop by calling the open source Transport for London API.
